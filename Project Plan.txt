After looking at multiple options, Spencer found https://www.maket.ai/.  It generates different
types of floor plans, but issues can be found, like room without doors, rooms that don't connect,
and others.  From this, a plan was made to have a small working model.  It consists of a prompt
phase, a drawing phase and a verification phase.

The prompt phase would turn user statements into usable keywords, like bedroom 20x14 or kitchen
25x30, so the drawing phase can be executed.

The drawing phase would use Python's Turtle Graphics, https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html,
to draw the different possibilities from the keywords.  The drawing tool should have a minimum code as
possible, and relay on logic to determine where to draw.  For now, as it only draws rectangles, it
would be operated like Google's kids coding game, https://www.google.com/logos/2017/logo17/logo17.html.
Doors would also be generated at this stage, by either erasing parts after drawing, of by lifting the
Turtle pen at predetermined positions.

Finally, the verification phase would generate a path between every room to make sure all of them are
accessible from the inside.
