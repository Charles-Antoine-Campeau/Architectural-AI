An open-source software, FreeCad, has been found while developing prototype 2.
FreeCad (https://www.freecad.org/) can be used for anything related to 3D modeling,
from CAD and CAM to achitecture.  Python Macros can also be used to generate all
the elements.

Similar to previous prototypes, a csv with room details will be used to generate
the walls of each room

1) have a CSV file with:
	Name, x size, y size, position (North, South, East, West)

2) Python macro loads the csv file as pandas dataframe

3) draw the house plan using Freecad
