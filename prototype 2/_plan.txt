The previous prototype could not dynamically or correctly add more than four rooms.
To counter that issue, Raylib, a game engine library, will be used to make the rooms
"fall" in place similar to a game of Tetris.

1) have a CSV file with the rooms name, size, and position (North, South, East, West)

2) C# script gets the file and save as an array

3) C# script uses Raylib to spawn an anchor room, then make the others fall in place
   from the proper direction
